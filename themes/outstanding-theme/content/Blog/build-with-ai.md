## Overview
Build with AI is a new way to create surveys, and it's powered by OpenAI. The user types short instructions. Then AI generates a survey accordingly. It's fast, accurate, and results in high-quality surveys. 

## My role
I wrote all the user interface copy, led feature naming efforts, and tested the content for usability. Keep reading to find out how I wrote outstanding instructions and other content that made this feature the #1 way new users create surveys. 

## The challenge
It’s hard to write a good survey. You have to know what questions to ask, how to ask them, and in what order. And even if you can do all those things, writing a survey can take a lot of time. How could AI help? 

## Business goals
We wanted to see a high number of customers deploying (sending) surveys with this feature. People who deploy tend to stick around. And we hoped to increase conversions from free to paid accounts. 

## Process

### Step 1: Identify content needs
I conducted the following foundational research:
* Conversation mining
* Competitive analysis
* Prompt engineering exploration

Here’s my key takeaway: Nearly all GPT products offered sample prompts to help users get started. The product designer and I discussed these findings. We agreed that prompt writing would be our key challenge.

### Step 2: Name the feature
I organized a feature naming workshop with cross functional stakeholders. Our activities were as follows:
* Align on criteria for the name.
* Brainstorm names according to those criteria.
* Choose three of our best options.
* Then I surveyed 200 people and asked them which of those three names they liked best. Names appeared in random order to each respondent to prevent bias. I announced the winner to stakeholders and started working it into the product.

### Step 3: Write the UI copy
I knew from my research that many users wouldn’t be able to write prompts without guidance. So I built on the idea of sample prompts from other products.
* Novice users could use the prompts without making changes.
* More articulate users could edit the prompts to suit their needs.
* Savvy users could model their own prompts after our samples.

I worked with one of our survey methodology experts to develop and test the right prompt structure.

### Step 4: Test the content
I tested a prototype with five real users to answer these questions:
* Will people know what a prompt is?
* Is the purpose of the sample prompts clear?
* Does the term “sample prompt” make sense?

Participants attempted tasks like using one of the sample prompts and defining the word “prompt.” All participants were able to complete all tasks.

## Results / impact
There are five ways to create a survey with SurveyMonkey. Here's where Build with AI ranks among them all:

* **1st place in activations**
   * Indicates test surveys sent to at least one person
* **2nd place in deploys**
   * Indicates surveys with several real responses

### User quote
> “SurveyMonkey’s Build with AI feature made creating surveys a breeze, even for someone with zero AI experience like myself. The AI feature exceeded my expectations, allowing me to effortlessly craft a comprehensive and professional survey for our sister non-profit groups. In just three attempts, I had a survey ready for board approval. Thank you, SurveyMonkey, for making survey creation not only simple and intuitive but also enjoyable!”
