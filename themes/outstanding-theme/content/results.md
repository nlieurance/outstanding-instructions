My work boosts user satisfaction and retention. It lowers support volume and reduces time-to-resolution of support tickets.

## SurveyMonkey logic

### Challenge
SurveyMonkey logic—which skips, hides, or changes survey content based on certain conditions—was super confusing. It didn’t work with randomized questions or pages. Logic on a page nullified logic on a question. It wasn’t possible to skip respondents from one question to another on the same page of a survey. All of these things were obstacles that made the feature too hard for so many users.

### My Solution
The designer and I reviewed support cases, looked at competitor products, and agreed that we’d have to use content to guide people through challenges. I did pair-writing with a SME from the HC team who had worked in Support. 

### Results
Our solution was to show contextual guidance at the moment users need it. And success with logic went from 22% during a benchmarking test to 95% in a recent test.
