  <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Build with AI is a new way to create surveys, and it&rsquo;s powered by OpenAI. The user types short instructions. Then AI generates a survey accordingly. It&rsquo;s fast, accurate, and results in high-quality surveys.</p>
<h2 id="my-role">My role</h2>
<p>I wrote all the user interface copy, led feature naming efforts, and tested the content for usability. Keep reading to find out how I wrote outstanding instructions and other content that made this feature the #1 way new users create surveys.</p>
<h2 id="the-challenge">The challenge</h2>
<p>It’s hard to write a good survey. You have to know what questions to ask, how to ask them, and in what order. And even if you can do all those things, writing a survey can take a lot of time. How could AI help?</p>
<h2 id="business-goals">Business goals</h2>
<p>We wanted to see a high number of customers deploying (sending) surveys with this feature. People who deploy tend to stick around. And we hoped to increase conversions from free to paid accounts.</p>
<h2 id="process">Process</h2>
<h3 id="step-1-identify-content-needs">Step 1: Identify content needs</h3>
<p>I conducted the following foundational research:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conversation mining</li>
<li>Competitive analysis</li>
<li>Prompt engineering exploration</li>
</ul>
<p>Here’s my key takeaway: Nearly all GPT products offered sample prompts to help users get started. The product designer and I discussed these findings. We agreed that prompt writing would be our key challenge.</p>

<h3 id="step-2-name-the-feature">Step 2: Name the feature</h3>
<p>I organized a feature naming workshop with cross functional stakeholders. Our activities were as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Align on criteria for the name.</li>
<li>Brainstorm names according to those criteria.</li>
<li>Choose three of our best options.</li>
<li>Then I surveyed 200 people and asked them which of those three names they liked best. Names appeared in random order to each respondent to prevent bias. I announced the winner to stakeholders and started working it into the product.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="../../placeholder.png" alt="Placeholder"></p>
<h3 id="step-3-write-the-ui-copy">Step 3: Write the UI copy</h3>
<p>I knew from my research that many users wouldn’t be able to write prompts without guidance. So I built on the idea of sample prompts from other products.</p>
<ul>
<li>Novice users could use the prompts without making changes.</li>
<li>More articulate users could edit the prompts to suit their needs.</li>
<li>Savvy users could model their own prompts after our samples.</li>
</ul>
<p>I worked with one of our survey methodology experts to develop and test the right prompt structure.</p>
<p><img src="../../placeholder.png" alt="Placeholder"></p>
<h3 id="step-4-test-the-content">Step 4: Test the content</h3>
<p>I tested a prototype with five real users to answer these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Will people know what a prompt is?</li>
<li>Is the purpose of the sample prompts clear?</li>
<li>Does the term “sample prompt” make sense?</li>
</ul>
<p>Participants attempted tasks like using one of the sample prompts and defining the word “prompt.” All participants were able to complete all tasks.</p>

<h2 id="results--impact">Results / impact</h2>
<p>There are five ways to create a survey with SurveyMonkey. Here&rsquo;s where Build with AI ranks among them all:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1st place in activations</strong>
<ul>
<li>Indicates test surveys sent to at least one person</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>2nd place in deploys</strong>
<ul>
<li>Indicates surveys with several real responses</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="user-quote">User quote</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“SurveyMonkey’s Build with AI feature made creating surveys a breeze, even for someone with zero AI experience like myself. The AI feature exceeded my expectations, allowing me to effortlessly craft a comprehensive and professional survey for our sister non-profit groups. In just three attempts, I had a survey ready for board approval. Thank you, SurveyMonkey, for making survey creation not only simple and intuitive but also enjoyable!”</p></blockquote>
